DDLs:
Creating the accounts table ->
CEATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `accounts` (
	`id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  	`username` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  	`password` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  	`email` varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=2 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;

NOTE: I only used one table, in my opinion it was enough
--------------------------------------------------------

DMLs:
In registering ->
'SELECT id, password FROM accounts WHERE username = ?' -- checking if username already exists
'INSERT INTO accounts (username, password, email, phone) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)' -- creating new account with its data
NOTE: the '?' in the query is used to denote that this value will not be fixed, rather it'll be changing while being fetched from the database
and we use the keyword bind_param('i', $_SESSION['id']); to specify the datatype of this value along with its name

In ligging in ->
'SELECT id, password FROM accounts WHERE username = ?' -- Verifying the user's credentials

In home page ->
"SELECT id, username, email, phone 
	FROM accounts" -- getting all users' information to display them on screen

In profile page ->
'SELECT password, email, phone FROM accounts WHERE id = ?' -- getting the sigend in user's information to display them on the screen
